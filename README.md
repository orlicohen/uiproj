Welcome to FoundIt! 

People lose things all the time, and campus communities are large, making it difficult to get in touch with the owners of lost objects.
Our goal was to create an app that would widen the network of individuals looking for lost objects, and make it easier for object losers and finders to connect through an incentivized, live-input application.
We decrease the barrier to entry for finders by making reporting a found item as easy as possible. We want to target campus communities, where this problem is easier to solve,
and leverage their size and tight-knitted nature.

Our design is a comprehensive lost and found platform that enables users to both report and finds lost items. Our solution attempts to minimize the scope of a
lost item as much as possible in order to not inundate users with irrelevant items; “losers” can search both by item description and move around the map 
by physical location and “finders” can pick a specific point and input descriptive tags about the item. In order to ensure the use of the app, 
we have implemented a feature to join communities within the app. This can be a class community (possibly connected to courseworks) or a
building community of your res hall. The app also includes verification steps to ensure fair usage. 

In this repo, you can find the pixel perfect HTML/CSS for some of the key screens in the design. For further understanding of the app's flow, 
see the .fig file submitted in our checkpoint 5.
